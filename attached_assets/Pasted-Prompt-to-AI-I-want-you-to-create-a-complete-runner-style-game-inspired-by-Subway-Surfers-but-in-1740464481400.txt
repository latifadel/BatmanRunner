Prompt to AI:

"I want you to create a complete runner-style game inspired by Subway Surfers, but in a simplified 2D format. Please provide three separate files: index.html, style.css, and script.js. Include the following requirements and details:

Game Concept & Mechanics

The player controls a main character running forward down a multi-lane path.
The character can switch lanes (left or right) and jump (or ‘dodge’) to avoid obstacles.
Obstacles should spawn periodically in different lanes and at various intervals.
Incorporate a scoring system that increases over time or with collected items (e.g., coins).
The game ends when the player collides with an obstacle.
Add a way to restart the game when it ends.
Styling & Assets

Make it visually appealing, using gradients, shadows, smooth animations, and transitions.
The background should be dynamic (e.g., moving or parallax-like effect) to give a sense of constant forward motion.
The main character and obstacles can be simple shapes or minimal sprites (if easily included) but styled nicely using CSS.
Include a ‘start screen’ or overlay with a play button.
Design a game-over screen or message that pops up on collision.
HTML Structure (index.html)

Set up a basic HTML structure with a <canvas> or container for the game area.
Include any necessary sections for the scoreboard, game-over messages, or instructions.
Ensure the JavaScript and CSS files are properly linked.
CSS Styling (style.css)

Use advanced CSS styling (e.g., transitions, hover effects, keyframe animations) to add visual interest.
Make the background look dynamic or city-themed to evoke a Subway Surfers feel.
Style the character, obstacles, and any game interface elements (score text, buttons).
Create a responsive layout if possible, so it works on desktop and mobile.
JavaScript Functionality (script.js)

Set up the game loop using requestAnimationFrame() or a similar approach.
Implement character movement (lane switching, jumping).
Randomly generate obstacles in different lanes at set intervals or based on time.
Detect collisions between the character and obstacles.
Keep track of and display the current score.
Handle game-over logic, such as stopping the game loop, showing a restart button, and resetting everything.
Optionally, add collectible items (coins, power-ups, etc.) that increase score or speed.
Additional Details

Comment your code thoroughly to explain how each part works.
Use well-named variables and functions for clarity.
If you have any suggestions for improvement or additional ideas (like power-ups, different character skins, or background music), feel free to include them.
At the end, provide me with:*

The complete index.html code.
The complete style.css code.
The complete script.js code.
Make sure all the files work together to create a cohesive and beautiful runner-style game.
Thank you!"*
